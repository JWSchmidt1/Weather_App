# Weather App - Ionic Framework

**Description:**

**Weather App**

This mobile application, developed with the Ionic framework, provides real-time weather information. The project was created in response to an assignment given to me by my teacher at some point in 2022.

### Key Points:

- **Assignment-based Development:** The Weather App was developed as part of an assignment given by my teacher, showcasing the practical application of Ionic framework skills acquired during the course.

- **Static Data:** Due to challenges with obtaining an API key, the app currently uses static data instead of real-time information. While the dynamic functionality is not available, the app still demonstrates the design and implementation aspects of working with Ionic.

- **Mobile Compatibility:** Built with the Ionic framework, the Weather App offers a responsive and user-friendly experience on various mobile devices.

**Note:** The app is designed to provide users with weather information, although the data is currently static due to API key issues. Explore the app to see the design and functionality implemented with Ionic.

Feel free to explore the APP.
